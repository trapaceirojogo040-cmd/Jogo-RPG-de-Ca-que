## 2024-07-25 - Improving Readability of Raw Data Dumps

**Learning:** Raw dictionary outputs in a terminal application are functional but create a poor user experience. They are hard to scan and lack visual hierarchy. A simple formatting function that adds color and structure can dramatically improve readability and make the interface feel more polished and professional.

**Action:** In future terminal-based applications, I will look for opportunities to replace raw data prints with formatted, color-coded outputs. This small effort provides a significant UX boost with minimal code changes.
